Welcome to **warposteam**!

We are a community dedicated to research, development, and experimentation in operating systems and low-level open source software. Our projects aim to serve both as learning resources and as platforms for innovation in systems programming.

## Main Project

- [**WarpOS**](https://codeberg.org/warposteam/warpos-src)  
  An experimental operating system written in Zig, C and Rust, focused on performance, modularity, and low-level systems study.

## Important Update 🚨
**WarpOS source code has moved to Codeberg!**  
We've migrated our repository to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/warposteam) to embrace full open-source transparency (as Codeberg is entirely open-source) and to accelerate development. This move will also simplify project maintenance and collaboration.

## Our Values

- **Open Source & Collaboration:** We encourage participation from everyone, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer.
- **Education:** Our projects are designed to be accessible foundations for those learning about operating systems, computer architecture, and programming close to the hardware.
- **Experimentation:** New ideas and approaches are always welcome!
