## 🚀 Our Mission

The **Renux OS Team** is the organization that maintains and develops **RenuxOS** and its related tools. Our mission is to build an operating system that values **clarity, modularity, and hacker-level control**.

We believe that people who think differently can build different systems. Our projects are a manifestation of this philosophy: they are a playground for experimentation, a testament to the power of simplicity, and an open invitation to everyone who loves low-level technology.
