Welcome to **warposteam**!

We are a community dedicated to research, development, and experimentation in operating systems and low-level open source software. Our projects aim to serve both as learning resources and as platforms for innovation in systems programming.

## Main Project

- [**WarpOS**](https://github.com/warposteam/warpos-src)  
  An experimental operating system written in C and Zig, focused on performance, modularity, and low-level systems study.

## Our Values

- **Open Source & Collaboration:** We encourage participation from everyone, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer.
- **Education:** Our projects are designed to be accessible foundations for those learning about operating systems, computer architecture, and programming close to the hardware.
- **Experimentation:** New ideas and approaches are always welcome!
